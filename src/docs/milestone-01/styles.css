/*CSS file for milestone 1*/
/* 
REQUIREMENTS

1. **Element Selector Rule**: Define a CSS rule that targets a specific HTML element, 
 such as **`p`** or **`h1`**, to apply universal styling features like font size or text 
 color to all instances of that element within your document.
2. **ID Selector Rule**: Craft a CSS rule targeting a unique id within your HTML document, 
 such as **`#overview`**, allowing you to apply specific styling to that section alone, distinguishing 
 it visually from other parts of the document.
3. **Class Selector Rule**: Utilize a CSS rule applied to a class, enabling you to style 
 a group of elements that share the same class attribute. This is useful for applying consistent
 styling to elements that perform similar functions, like buttons or section headers.
4. **Nested-Tag / Sub-Element Selector Rule**: Implement a CSS rule that targets elements
 within a specific context, for example, styling **`<a>`** tags differently when they appear
 within the **`<nav>`** element versus elsewhere in the document.
5. **Pseudo-Class Selector Rule**: Include a rule that uses a pseudo-class, such as 
 **`a:hover`** or **`a:focus`**, to define styles for an element in a particular state. 
 This enhances the interactivity and accessibility of your document by providing visual cues to users.
