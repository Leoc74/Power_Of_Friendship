            <h2>Overview</h2>
            Prix is a very helpful web application that allows online shoppers to do all their browsing all in one site.
            Gone are the days of looking up the price of certain products one site at a time and manually comparing which
            one is cheapest, or has the best deals. With Prix, shoppers will be able to not only search for any product on 
            the internet, but will also be given price comparisons, additional information on the product including shipping 
            and/or possible deals, and the ability to filter out and sort products with given criteria. When the shopper finds
            a product they like, a link will be availableto direct them to the external site for purchase. Find whatever your 
            heart desires, all in one tab, with Prix.

            <p> Users of Prix will have access to filtering and sorting in order to enhance
                their shopping experience. Results can be sorted by date of release
                (earliest to latest, latest to earliest), popularity, price
                 (highest to lowest, lowest to highest), etc. Results can also be filtered
                  based on a variety of factors, such as price ranges, modes and rates of shipping,
                   location, customer ratings, etc</p>

            <h3>Product Detail Frames:</h3>
            <p> When Prix users search up a product, the results will be shown in an informative and clean manner. Each individual product will have its own frame which will display important information, such as price, original product site, the number of confirmed purchases, and more. Additional information will be available and displayed when the user hovers over the frame.
            
            <h3>Product Comparison Tool:</h3>

            <p> If any site users find that certain products’ links no longer work or are sold out, they will be given the option to report that product, and if there are a substantial number of reports of that given product, Prix will remove the product from search results.
