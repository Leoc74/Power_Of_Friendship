            <h2>Overview</h2>
            Prix is a very helpful web application that allows online shoppers to do all their browsing all in one site.
            Gone are the days of looking up the price of certain products one site at a time and manually comparing which
            one is cheapest, or has the best deals. With Prix, shoppers will be able to not only search for any product on 
            the internet, but will also be given price comparisons, additional information on the product including shipping 
            and/or possible deals, and the ability to filter out and sort products with given criteria. When the shopper finds
            a product they like, a link will be availableto direct them to the external site for purchase. Find whatever your 
            heart desires, all in one tab, with Prix.

            <h3>Filtering and Sorting Options:</h3>
            <p> Users of Prix will have access to filtering and sorting in order to enhance
                their shopping experience. Results can be sorted by date of release
                (earliest to latest, latest to earliest), popularity, price
                 (highest to lowest, lowest to highest), etc. Results can also be filtered
                  based on a variety of factors, such as price ranges, modes and rates of shipping,
                   location, customer ratings, etc</p>

            <h3>Product Detail Frames:</h3>
            <p> When Prix users search up a product, the results will be shown in an informative and clean manner. Each individual product will have its own frame which will display important information, such as price, original product site, the number of confirmed purchases, and more. Additional information will be available and displayed when the user hovers over the frame.
            
            <h3>Product Comparison Tool:</h3>
            <p> When users find a certain product they may consider purchasing, they can click the product to save it to the Product Comparison Tool. If more than one product is selected, our tool will automatically create a comprehensive report that will list the individual products’ information, highlight pros and cons, and give our recommendation on which product to purchase, via our own algorithm.
                Analytic and Insight Suggestions: Prix collects vital information about products and how well they sell in order to provide suggestions and recommendations for future shoppers. When a customer finds a product and completes a purchase, that record of sale will be </p>

            <h3>Reporting and Flagging:</h3>
            <p> If any site users find that certain products’ links no longer work or are sold out, they will be given the option to report that product, and if there are a substantial number of reports of that given product, Prix will remove the product from search results.

            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <h3>Product info </h3>
            The foundation of our application lies in comprehensive product information sourced from 
            multiple clothing shopping websites. This includes details such as product name, description,
             brand, size availability, color options, material composition, and pricing. Ensuring the 
             accuracy and completeness of this data is crucial for enabling users to make informed 
             purchasing decisions. Our wireframe for product information displays a structured layout,
              emphasizing clarity and ease of navigation, ensuring users can quickly access vital details 
              about each item.
            
            <h3>User preference</h3>
            Understanding user preferences is essential for delivering personalized recommendations. 
            We collect data on user preferences, including preferred price range, material preferences 
            (cotton, polyester), preferred colors, preferred brands, and any specific keywords or styles
            users are searching for. By leveraging this information, we can tailor search results to match
            each user's unique preferences. The wireframe for user preferences features intuitive 
            controls and customizable options, empowering users to refine their search criteria effortlessly.

            <h3>Data</h3>
            Our application relies on scraping data from various clothing shopping websites to gather 
            real-time pricing information and product availability. This data includes product listings, prices,
             discounts, and stock availability. We continuously update and monitor this data to ensure that
              users are presented with the most current and accurate information available. The wireframe for 
              data collection showcases an efficient data retrieval process, emphasizing speed and reliability 
              to provide users with up to date information seamlessly.
            
            <h3>Search Query</h3>
            Analyzing user search queries provides valuable insights into emerging trends and popular clothing items.
             We collect and analyze search query data to identify patterns, popular brands, trending styles, and
            frequently searched keywords. This information helps us optimize our search algorithms and enhance 
            the overall user experience. The wireframe for search query analysis displays a user-friendly interface
            for exploring search trends, enabling users to discover new styles and stay informed about the latest
            fashion trends effortlessly.

                <img src="images\HomePage.jpg" width="600" alt="Home Page">
                <div>First off we have the <b>Home Page</b>. At the top we have the name of our website in the corner, Prix, which when clicked brings the user back to the home screen. There is a search bar on the top so seasoned users have to waste no time to start searching. Then we have a nav bar to allow easy access to other pages, and a log-in button in the top left. Underneath that we have a brief description of what Prix so new users know what the site is about. This part may include some tips and tricks on how to use the site effectively, or that may be added to a separate page. Then we have an image/product carousel which rotates through popular purchases potentially giving the user ideas on what they want. Finally we have a larger search bar at the bottom, where users can search for products.
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="images\LoginPage.jpg" width="600" alt="Login Page">
              <div>Next we have a <b>Login Page</b>. This is a rather common set-up. We have the link to the home page as Prix in the top left. The nav bar on the top, notably without the log-in link as we are already at that page. Then the user can either enter a username and password, or log-in with Google. And if they do not have an account there is a link to create one. This page is meant to be familiar to users as it is set up similarly to other websites. This provides users a sense of comfort as well as allowing them to navigate the page easily and with confidence.
              </div>

            <div>
              <img src="images\SearchPage.jpg" width="600" alt="Search Page">
              <div>This view showcases our <b>Search Screen</b>. The top is very similar to the other pages, but in the top right if you are logged in it will be replaced with a link to your account/account settings. Then in the main page we have a large search bar, as that is the primary focus of this page. Then we have a sort by button which can be expanded and you can select various options like price, relevancy, recency and more. Then underneath after a search all the results will show up in a list format. Finally we have a button on the right labeled filters which will expand a side-bar with all the various filter options. This will be touched on more in the next wireframe.

              <div>This wireframe is the same as the one above, except now we have the <b>Filters Tab</b> expanded. This is rather important for our project because filters will play a large role. There will be options like price limits, free shipping, websites to ignore, how recent it was posted on the original site, and much more. These filters are meant to make shopping significantly easier for our users, especially since it is meant to be an alternative to things like Google. This is why it is so important to have this wireframe.

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            This project will require us to pull from lots of previous knowledge obtained from our time so far here at UMass. From our basic computer science classes like CS 121 and CS 187 to more advanced ones like CS 220 and CS 230 the knowledge from these courses will be useful one way or another. For example in CS 220 we learned JavaScript, Promises, and perhaps most importantly good coding practices which are integral for creating a project on a larger scale. This project will also allow us to link multiple skills together, old and new. Combining HTML and CSS which were primarily learned in this course with JavaScript which was largely learned in CS 220, and whatever we need to learn as we go to make the project work. 
            Furthermore an emphasis is placed on solving a real world problem. Not only is our web application designed to solve a real-world issue but the creation of a website itself is something very common in the real-world which is essential for a successful integrative experience.
